## Problem Statement: Implement Logging in Angular

        
* Certainly! Logging is an essential part of any application for debugging and monitoring purposes. In Angular, you can use the built-in 'console' object for logging messages. Here's a exercise that involves setting up logging in an Angular application


To solve the problem, you need to complete the following steps:

**Note**: Components provided in this exercise will show compilation errors when the exercise is cloned locally.
You need to go through the comments thoroughly and complete the exercise.
  
    1. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
    2. Classes and methods should be completed by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors.
    3. Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass.
    4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
    5. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
    6. To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
