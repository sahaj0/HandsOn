## Problem Statement: Implement validations in Angular

        
* Certainly! Validations in Angular are an essential part of ensuring that user input meets the required criteria. Here's a exercise on validations in Angular.


To solve the problem, you need to complete the following steps:

**Note**: Components provided in this exercise will show compilation errors when the exercise is cloned locally.
You need to go through the comments thoroughly and complete the exercise.
  
    1. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
    2. Classes and methods should be completed by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors.
    3. Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass.
    4. Form Validation: 
       Implement the following validations:
        - All fields are required.
        - 'firstName' and 'lastName' fields contain only text (no numbers or special characters).
        - Email validation for the email field.
        - Password should have a minimum length of 8 characters.
        - Password should contains at least one uppercase letter and one special character.
    5. Display error messages for each validation rule. For example, display a message if the email is not valid, the password is too short.
    6. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
    7. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
    8. To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
